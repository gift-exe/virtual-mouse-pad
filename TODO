- Implement relative mouse movement: 
    - let the mouse continue from where it was, when the finger is recognized
    - instead of going to an "initial" position
- Implement mouse acceleration:
    - If there's an acceleration in finger movement, then the mouse cursor movement speed should be accelerated.
- Implement clicking
    - I still cannot think of a neat mechanism for clicking
- Implement scrolling 
    - Two fingers together (index and middle finger) would set a trigger for scrolling
    - A change in position of these fingers across the x and y axis would be used to determin scroll direction
