- Multithreading does not really improve the performance of the system (well atlease for now)
    - I feel the reason could prbably be because of python's GIL ... I do not think it is time to "fix" this issue yet

- Try out new smoothing techniques; this moving average get issues, particularly in creating a localization effect. This effect occurs when 
  the mouse stays in one position for a while â€” typically when my hand is on the screen but not moving. When I move my finger again, the mouse 
  cursor tends to return to the previous stationary position.
  This is likely due to the current smoothing formula using a moving average. Since many data points are collected from that stationary position, the smoothed coordinates tend to revert to it.
  - Some Techniques to try
    - Low Pass Filter
    - Exponential Moving Average (since they say it responds better to recent changes)
